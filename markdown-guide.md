## About 
> Blacksheep music is a New-England based collective for friends and artists alike. The basic idea is that we (the artists)
> pool resources and energy together in order to help one another achieve both personal and cooperative artistic projects. Ultimately,
> we hope to collect enough funds to establish a communal recording studio. If interested in getting involved, email elizeltzer@bennington.edu
